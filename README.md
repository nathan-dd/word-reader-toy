# Make your own Word Reader toy!
Here you will find a tutorial and all needed ressources to construct a DIY Word reader toy from scratch!
This work is still in progress. As of now (Jan 31st, 2022) there's not much in there. I've barely scratched the surface and there's much prototyping to do, let alone productizing.

Most parents will know a phase where their kids learnt the alphabet, and ask them how `[INSERT RANDOM LETTER COMBINATION]` sounds. Over. And. Over. Again.

I mean I found that fun anyway, but I though I could maybe accelerate the process by letting my kid learn that on her own, with a toy.
