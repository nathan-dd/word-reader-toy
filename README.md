# Make your own Word Reader toy!
Here you will find a tutorial and all needed ressources to construct a DIY Word reader toy from scratch!
This work is still in progress. As of now (Jan 31st, 2022) there's not much in there. I've barely scratched the surface and there's much prototyping to do, let alone productizing.

## Intro

Most kids have a phase where, just after learning the alphabet, they will spend hours on end asking what `[RANDOM LETTER COMBINATION]` sounds like.

This is actually pretty fun to do with your kid! But as a complementary tool to help them learn how to read faster, here is a toy that cuts the middle man (that is, you) and tell the word that your kid has created out of random letters, automatically.

## Give me more details about this toy!


## But how does it work actually?

This toy is composed of four parts:

1. word bank and sound generation, composed of a DF Player Pro and a Speaker, with a word dataset and a jupyter notebook to produce the word bank
2. letter recognition, composed of 8 proximity + color sensor, 8 white LEDs and an I2C multiplexer
3. an orchestration piece composed of an Arduino microcontroller and an action button
4. the actual letters, composed of knock-off Scrabble letters and colored stickers
